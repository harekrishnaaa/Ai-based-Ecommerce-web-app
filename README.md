So I have built an AI-based Shopping system that uses a chatbot to perform all operations from adding, removing items to proceeding to checkout. This will be a web application with a backend server as well. This project is an attempt to provide the advantages of online shopping to customers of a real shop. It helps to buy the products in the shop anywhere through the internet by using the website. The customer will be provided the service of online shopping and home delivery by using this website application. This system can be implemented in any shop in the locality or to multinational branded shops having retail outlet chains.

The web app was made using React, Node, Express, MongoDB and Alan.ai which is platform to build chatbots and integrate with your web and native apps.  I recommend you to go through the [docs](https://alan.app/docs/) before getting started to work on my project.

## Development setup
Developement setup is pretty simple, first you just need to install all dependencies which is already given in package.json file and then just run the web app with the commands given below.

- For Client -

```sh
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
- For server - 
```sh
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Make sure in client/src/utils and then in axios.js make the baseURL as url of the Node's Localhost server.

I have made a dummy test account for to login - 
Username - test
Password  - 1234

# Some important point to go through (MUST READ)

1. Most of the issues I will be posting will be related to the client or the frontend side at first.
2. I will be deploying the final web app with all the commited changes in the end to see how much we have improved the web app from its initial version.
